# sensor-network-project

In this project for my Computer Networks class, I simulate the behavior of 100-250 nodes in an environment where they track targets in an area and transmit recorded information to a gateway node by hopping through multiple intermediate sensor nodes which also record and transmit data. Each sensor node starts with a certain amount of energy which decreases depending on the actions it takes, and each node calculates the shortest distance back to the gateway node using Dijkstra's algorithm.
